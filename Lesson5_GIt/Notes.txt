1. Install git
https://git-scm.com/install/linuxgit
Run command /sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa/
Run command /sudo apt update/ /sudo apt install git/

2. Check if we have installed
Run /git --help/

3. Configure
Run /git config --list/
git config --global user.name "ThienDONG"
git config --global user.email "thiendn061@gmail.com"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "thiendn061@gmail.com"

The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:........................thiendn061@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
+----[SHA256]-----+

Now in the ~/.ssh folder, it include 2 file
+ id_ed25519 (private key)
+ id_ed25519.pub (public key) we will use it to connect to github

4. Read the public file
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Then copy
ssh-ed25519 .............................. thiendn061@gmail.com

5. Check to makesure the connection
ssh -T git@github.com

As we have connected with github, we added "github.com" ED25519 to the list of known hosts


NOTE:
If we want to use git on windows system of this machine, we need to configure the git again on windows system
Because
- If we work on one Project -> ONe repository in github
- sometime work on Utunbu, sometime on windows
----> we need to configure one GIt on Windows as well
Ubuntu → SSH key A → GitHub repo
Windows → SSH key B → GitHub repo


WORKING WITH GIT AFTER LINKING GIT TO GITHUB WITH .SSH (config)

1. Create project that link with git
run /git init/ in the project you want to sync with github
2. To remove the .git in the project, run /rm -rf .git/
3. When a code file: i.e. temp.txt, haha.py created (by default, they are untracked by git), to allow git tracking them, run /git add filename.ext/
Now, all the files are in "STAGING AREA", and the modification will be tracked
-->>> git add filename (put file to STAGING AREA)
-->>> git add --all (to add all files to staging area)
4. To commit, run "git commit", it will commit all files are currently in the "STAGING AREA"
/git commit -m "message"/ to commit file with a message after changing so git can track control version
- This change will be tracked with an "Index"

5. Check git status /git status/, Check logging /git log/

6. How to go back to previous stage ? (Time travel)
Each commit will generate a code (by checking /git log/), for instance, th project step 3 has the code:
4170b50e74b3a4d1dcaa745458ad2d0beddc554e
we can run /git revert 4170b50e74b3a4d1dcaa745458ad2d0beddc554e/ to go back to step 3


### GIT BRANCH ###
1. Check branch /git branch/, rename the current branch /git branch -M new_branch_name/
2. Create one more branch /git checkout -b branch_name/
Note: if we change file on one branch, the other branches will stay the same, we can merge it later
3. Change brach /git checkout branch_name/
Note: if we commit information on one branch, the other branches will not be modify
4. To merge two branches /git merge
For instance, we are currenly in branch "main", while newer information in branch "new_feature", to merge it using
/git merge
Note: the current branch we are in, if we create the next branch, this branch will take all inheritation of the current branch

### GITHUB ### - Remote repo
# After commit to local git, we now want to push it to github, or pull some version from github and continue working on locall
1. Create repo on github
After creating a repo on github, we receive:
--- a HTTPs link: https://github.com/AlexNDong/Gitdemo.git
--- or a SSH link: git@github.com:AlexNDong/Gitdemo.git
2. Clone remote repo to our working directory
THe remote repo is in link: https://github.com/AlexNDong/Gitdemo.git
TO clone, we open terminal in directory we want to work on that and command: /git clone https://github.com/AlexNDong/Gitdemo.git/
Example: ~/Documents/FSWE/Lesson5_GIt/git_practice$ git clone https://github.com/AlexNDong/Gitdemo.git
to clone a Gitdemo project in "git_practice" directory
In the Gitdemo directory, we also have git init
3. Push to remove repo
After making changes after clone a repo to local, commit, then we can push it to remote repo again using /git push
